# Defblade

Defblade is a game made from scratch with C++ and SDL2. Inspired by this color palette: [Paper 8 Palette - Lospec Palette List](https://lospec.com/palette-list/paper-8).

It is precision pixel art platformer with combat based elements, where you need to parcour across challenging obstacles and kill enemies in order to progress and survive. When you kill enemies you gain money, and when you die you lose money. When you have no money left it's game over.
